Spacestagram: Image-sharing from the final frontier

To test it ..  you can create a config.js file ..   with the following info .. 

   ` const config = {
    NASA_API_KEY:   "DEMO_KEY"
   } `
   
and either use your own Nasa API key ..   or you can use the key : DEMO_KEY

For more on the API key .. go to   https://api.nasa.gov -
